    "Answer: \n",
    "In each layer, the parameters to be estimated include the weights (for the features), the bias (or constant) term, and the number of neurons. So, the first layer has 1 constant, 10 weights, 512 neurons. 512 x 11 = 5,632. In the second layer, the neurons each have 512 weights and then the constant/bias term. There are 513 total parameters in the second layer, so 512 x 513 = 262,656 parameters. Third layer: 512 weights + 1 constant = 513 parameters. With the 512 neurons in the layer, 512 X 513 = 262,656 (same as second layer). Combine ALL parmeters (5,632 + 262,656(x2) = 530,944 parameters.) This is a LOT of parameters, especially in comparison to the classic ML models.  "
